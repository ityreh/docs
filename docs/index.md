### Setup a mouseless development environment

To setup my mouseless development environment I followed [this book](https://themouseless.dev/) by [Matthieu Cneude](https://github.com/Phantas0s) and I really recommend it.

You will see what I mean when you start using this approach in your daily development.

### Follow the 12 factor app guide

[The 12 factor app guide](https://12factor.net/) is a really good list of methodologies building software.
