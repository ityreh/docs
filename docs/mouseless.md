# Setup your mouseless development environment

To setup my mouseless development environment I followed [this book](https://themouseless.dev/) by [Matthieu Cneude](https://github.com/Phantas0s) and I really recommend it. The mouseless development environment is about using the mouse as less as possible to feel more comfortable and be more productive as a developer. You will see what I mean when you start using this approach in your daily development.
