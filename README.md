## Installation

The installation to my github.io website is automated with GitHub Actions.
If you want to deploy the documentation manually, you need to install mkdoc-material first:

```shell
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Then you can execute the deploymentscript:

```shell
./bin/deploy.sh
```
