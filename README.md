# mkdocs

This is the source of my documentation resources, where I take some notes for my development routine.

## Installation

To deploy the documentation, you need to install mkdoc-material first:

```shell
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Then you can execute the deploymentscript:

```shell
./bin/deploy.sh
```
